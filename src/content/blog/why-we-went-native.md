Growing up in a religious family, I was instilled with the values of helping others and making a positive impact in the world. My parents encouraged me to pursue a career in a field that aligned with these values, and that's how I found myself drawn to healthcare. In high school, I was part of a medical program that gave me the opportunity to shadow local healthcare professionals and learn about different areas of medicine. This experience solidified my desire to pursue a degree in Physical Therapy, and I went on to graduate with my Doctorate of Physical Therapy in 2017 from Ithaca College. Little did I know that my journey in healthcare would be a complex and challenging one.

## The Story so Far

Early on in my career as a Physical Therapist, I found working in healthcare to be extremely rewarding. I started my first job in a small sports focused clinic, where I was able to develop close relationships with my patients and provide personalized care. I felt fulfilled by the progress my patients made and the positive impact I was able to have on their lives. I truly felt that I was in a place where I could succeed and make a difference. However, as I advanced in my career, I found that even this small company became more focused on their bottom line than on the well-being of their patients or practitioners.

I sought jobs in different niches within Physical Therapy hoping a change of scenery would be what I needed. However, in these companies, I continued to feel pressure to see more patients in a shorter amount of time and to prioritize treatments that would maximize profits, rather than what was best for the patient's long-term health. This left me feeling conflicted and frustrated. I became increasingly disillusioned with the healthcare industry as I saw patients being treated more like customers and less like individuals who needed care. I began to realize that I could not continue down this path for the sake of my own mental health.

Ultimately, I made the difficult decision to leave healthcare altogether. While I loved being a Physical Therapist, I found that the pressure to prioritize profit over patient care was too much to bear. I wanted to work in an industry where my values aligned with the organization's values, and where the well-being of individuals was the top priority.

## Looking Forward

Following these experiences, I realize that there is a lot that needs to change in the healthcare industry. Patients should always be the top priority, and the focus should be on providing quality care that helps individuals achieve their health goals. As for me, I am now working in a the software engineering industry and am excited about my current opportunities. I've been fortunate enough to work with companies who's values align with my own, but I will always be grateful for the time I spent as a Physical Therapist and the impact I was able to have on my patients' lives.

In the future, I do hope to return to the health and wellness space. I have a strong passion for helping others and making a positive impact on people's lives, and I believe that healthcare can be an incredibly powerful tool for achieving that. However, I want to work in an environment that values patient care above all else.

I hope that one day I can combine my experience in tech and the medical fields to create a product and a company that delivers a more patient-centric approach to healthcare. I believe that there are ways to provide high-quality care to patients while also being financially sustainable, and I want to be part of making that a reality.

In the meantime, I am continuing to learn and grow in my new industry. I believe that the skills and experiences I am gaining will only make me a better healthcare professional in the future. I remain optimistic about the future of healthcare and look forward to the day when I can return to the field and bring care to patients in a manner that more closely aligns with the way I believe healthcare should be practiced.
